Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island Disassembly
by Raidenthequick and Thegreekbrit

Full Disassembly including:

-65816 code
-Super FX code
-SPC-700 code
-data sections

Disassembly is now 100% finished, assembles under asar and produces a fully clean ROM.

Target version:
V1.0 (NTSC-US)

Naming conventions:
-Please use all_lowercase_and_underscore_delimiting for label and variable names.
-Maximum label / variable name length is currently 22 characters. This is because of current spacing and addressing modes to take into account.
-Use suffix _s for "short" versions of labels, meaning nearlabels that only contain a single JMP or JML to a further label. Example is main_pause_s: JMP main_pause
-Use suffix _l for "long" versions of subroutines. Often these will just be slightly different entry points to a routine that also change the data bank to the current bank. Example is main_loop_0F_l: PHB PHK PLB main_loop_0F: ...
-Please try to follow the broad convention of prefixes init_, main_, and check_ when applicable for label names:
-init_ should be applied when a piece of code is meant to set something up and only runs one time for the lifespan of the operation / entity.
-main_ should be applied when a piece of code is meant to run every frame for a given operation / entity; it's what is driving it.
-check_ should be applied when a piece of code is primarily meant to check and see whether a certain operation / entity needs to be initialized, updated, or destroyed.
